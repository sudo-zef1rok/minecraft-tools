*When you run the program for the first time, you will open a page in the browser where you will have to copy your User-Agent and push it into the input line.
If the program gives an error or does not work, delete the file agent.txt if nothing changes, create a request in Issues or write to me in Discord.*

# Plans

- Add a minecraft and Discord authorization.
